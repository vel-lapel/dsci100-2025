    "\t- experience (chr) -> a categorical variable ranking each player's experience. The options are Pro, Veteran, Amateur, Regular, Beginner\n",
    "\t- hashedEmail (chr) -> shows each player's unique hashed email. Used to identify players. \n",
    "\t- name (chr) -> the name of each player. Also used to identify players\n",
    "\t- gender (chr) -> a categorical variable showing each player's gender. The options are Agender, Female, Male, Non-Binary, Other, Prefer Not to Say, Two-Spirited\n",
    "\t- played_hours (dbl) -> a numerical value of how many total hours each player has played.\n",
    "\t- Age (dbl) -> a numerical value corresponding to the age of each player. \n",

    "- start_time and end_time are character variables, which means that very few functions can be performed on them. This is not very tidy.\n"
